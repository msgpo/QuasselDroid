Build Requirements
------------------

It requires a recent Android SDK , and the new build system.
- http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and
- http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system#TOC-Contributing

It uses the following extra projects (though all support libraries are included
for your convenience):

 - Otto (Apache): http://square.github.com/otto/
 - MaterialTabs (Apache): https://github.com/neokree/MaterialTabs
 - FloatingActionButton (MIT): https://github.com/makovkastar/FloatingActionButton
 - Guava (Apache): https://github.com/google/guava
 - ACRA (Apache): https://github.com/ACRA/acra
 - Android Support Library (Apache): http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html  
   **Android Support Library requires the corresponding package to be installed in the SDK manager**

Building
--------
Building is done using gradle. Run "gradlew tasks" to see possible build tasks. Some useful tasks are
assemble and installDebug

Things to Note
--------------
We finally do support encryption and compression, but the service and the fragments need to be redone properly. Also the UI should get a complete makeover, preferably at the same time as reworking it to use Material Design.
